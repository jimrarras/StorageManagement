# StorageManagement
Small C# project implemented as voluntary work for Molecular Biology Unit of the Hematology Laboratory, PGNI Hospital of Ioannina.

Provides a simple UI containing a DataGrid and functions based on the needs of the lab. 
The DataGrid gets data from a local CSV file containing different reagents and the current Inventory View.
The user can keep track of the inventory, add or remove items by scanning the barcode on the reagent tag.
Each action is logged in a separate activity tab for transparency.

Essential features such as export as XLS file, printing are included.
Further expansion might be done with the permission and/or in collaboration with the hospital's IT team.

Expansion can contain connection with the hospital's local database, automated ordering of reagents plus UI/UX improvements.
